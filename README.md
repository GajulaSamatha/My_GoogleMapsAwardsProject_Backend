I am trying to just give a trail to Google Maps Awards Competition 2025. This is just a small static website, to calculate the fare amount can given to an auto rickshaw, private cabs, etc.
This is static website have only two pages, home page and calculating fare amount page i.e. fair.html.
I am just keeping here the backend for hosting purpose.
I calculates the fare amount based on the factors like:
  1) Fuel Price on that day
  2) Fetching the distance from two address, here for flexibilty I added live location detector.
  3) whether it is share auto or not?
  4) If it is too mid night then, paying some extra amount is not a bad thing, so I am taking that input too.
  5) and yeah, adding somr more amount to the work of the driver.
  6) If we want to consider the auto mileage also, then we can also do it by giving that input.
  7) And finally, if we want to give some tip to the driver, then we have to give the input how much we want to give.
Based on these factors this fare calculator works.
